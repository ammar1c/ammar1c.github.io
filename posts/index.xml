            <description>Hello fellow visitor. My name is Ammar Al-Batool. I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer who is interested in distributed systems. In this blog, I want to share all stuff related to communication, algorithms and distributed systems. This has been long overdue, but finally arrived.
For the past years, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at companies that deal with big scale, so I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated a fair share of interesting knowledge in this regard.
The layout might change, but the content will stay the same.</description>
