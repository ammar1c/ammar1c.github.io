## What

Distributed systems:

Leslie Lamport: "A distributed system is a system
in which a computer that you didn't know existed can
render your computer unusable"

## Why

Distributed systems are used when the capacity
of a single computer isn't enough to meet our needs. A single computer
have finite resources such network bandwidth, compute power, memory and persisten 
storage. 

There are other reasons for using distributed systems:
- Failure tolerance
- Latency
- Cost efficiency

## Pain

- partial failure are common
- messaged in the network get delayed, lost, duplicated or reordered
- failure can be hard to detect
- node clocks are unreliable
