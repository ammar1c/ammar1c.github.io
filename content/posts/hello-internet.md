Hello fellow visitor. My name is Ammar Al-Batool. I'm a software engineer
who is interested in distributed systems. In this blog, I want to share all stuff
related to communication, algorithms and distributed systems. This has been long overdue, but finally arrived. 

For the past years, I've worked at companies that deal with big scale, so I've accumulated
a fair share of interesting knowledge in this regard. 

The layout might change, but the content will stay the same.
